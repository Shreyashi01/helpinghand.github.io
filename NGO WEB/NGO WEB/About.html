    <div class="para" id="1"><p> Helping Hands Foundation was initiated in 2022 when a group of friends came together with the intention of giving back to the society. They were inspired by the thought and philosophy of Peter Senge, the founder of the Society for Organizational Learning who has propagated that “sustainability, social equality and the environment are now business problems…” and corporate leaders can’t expect governments to solve them alone.

        What triggered these thoughts was the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the 1990’s which brought with it immense opportunities. Business revived, and India became not just a market, but also an investment prospect for the developed world. Disposable incomes and early settlements became a living reality for the working middle-class. For the first time in India, professionals could think beyond making a living, and contribute towards the society.</p></div>

        <div class="grid3" id="4"><p><center>While our focus as a development organisation has been first and foremost to work on the ground for bringing positive change in the lives of the less privileged children and families, we have been making equal efforts to sustain this change, by sensitising and engaging the privileged masses towards their social responsibility. <br>

            Helping Hands Foundation has always looked upon its own role as that of a catalyst, a means of setting in motion and accelerating the process of development. But the true potential for bringing real, long lasting change, lies with the civil society. Not remaining restricted to the community, and with the aim of achieving sustainable development in a wider social context, Smile Foundation has adopted the principle of Civic Driven Change, making the civil society an active partner in all its welfare initiatives. <br>
            
            As a step towards this, Smile Foundation takes a multi-stakeholder approach, where it partners with indigenous community based organisations, international development organisations, local government and civic bodies, corporate, institutions, schools, media, communities and individuals, to exchange knowledge, combine resources and promote the ideal of shared growth. <br>
            
            We encourage eminent public figures and celebrities to take up their social responsibility and uphold good causes and right values, as known faces become role models of the society they are part of. We have also made short films and documentaries highlighting vital social issues and disseminated them through mass mediums like television, cinema and social media. In addition to this, mass sensitisation and awareness campaigns, and several other initiatives are undertaken regularly to engage different sections of the civil society.</center></p></div>

                    <center>We believe that education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one’s awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one’s rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen. Education is the most effective tool which helps children build a strong foundation; enabling them to free themselves from the vicious cycle of ignorance, poverty and disease.</center>

                        <p>Social Venture Philanthropy (SVP) is an innovative model based on the business concept of venture capital. Under SVP, Helping Hands Foundation identifies and implements its development projects through credible community based organizations. We also handhold and build capacities of these organizations, focusing on achieving scalability and sustainability, creating a culture of leadership and excellence and inculcating a deep sense of accountability among them.</p></div>

                        <p>Under Outreach model, Helping Hands Foundation implements the development interventions directly as it requires intensive and professional engagement for a wider and sustained outcome. While working in remote rural areas, we realized that an intensive on-ground intervention is needed, which might be beyond the capacity of community based organizations and hence, we directly implement such projects, liaising with local community stakeholders for better social return on investment.</p></div>
